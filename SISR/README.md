This is a content-changing extensions for Firefox for the very narrow purpose of
making it easier for me to jump from a student roster in SISR to an individual student in OASIS.

This adds an event handler on each SID on the SISR page that, when clicked, brings you to that
student's OASIS Academic Record.
