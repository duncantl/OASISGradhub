This is a content-changing extensions for Firefox for the very narrow purpose of
making it easier for me to work with the UC Davis OASIS Web interface in three specific ways

+ add a link to the student's gradhub page by using the SID on the page as the text for the link
+ in the Academic Record tab, ensure that all 7 columns are shown by default, not the regular 4.
+ when clicking on a course title in the Academic Record tab, this will display the course roster
  from SISR in a new tab.
+ clickin on a CRN in the Academic Record tab, shows the roster for the CRN for that quarter, again,
  in a new tab.
